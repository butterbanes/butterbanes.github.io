        <h1>About Me</h1>
            <h2>Where I'm From</h2>
                <p>
                    I grew up in Alabama around its Rocket City, being brought up by
                    two great parents. We currently have 2 pets right now, both
                    dogs: Ruby and Sadie
                </p>
            <h2>Education</h2>
                <p>
                    Being from the Huntsville area, it was only normal I went to
                    gradeschool at places no one has heard of. As for higher
                    education, I am currently pursuing my Bachelors of Science at
                    UNA as a Computer Science major. As far as minors go, I am
                    anticipated to receive a minor in Cybersecurity and Mathematics
                </p>
